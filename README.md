Computer Vision project

• This project was for my Computer Vision and Imaging Techniques class. The goal of the app is to tell the
breed of your dog when taking a picture or uploading an image of it. The app also provide a Learn More
button that redirect you to the wikipedia page related to your dog breed.

• Working on this project was the occasion for me to learn about deploying deep learning models. As on this
project I wanted to focus more on the deployment aspect, I did neither train the model on my personal
computer nor on google collab as I usually do, but I rather took advantage of Google Teachable Machine for
better accuracy of my model.
